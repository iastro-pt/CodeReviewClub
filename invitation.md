Dear all,
 
We would like to start a Code Review Club in IA. 
The first meeting will be integrated in this month's Programmers Club 
and will take place on **Thursday 9th, 11h** in the meeting room.

Questions:

*What is a code review?*  
A code review is when a group of people get together and talk about (a part of) one person's code.
This piece of code can either be something cool you discovered and would like to share,
something you would like feedback on (optimization, stuck on a problem, ...),
or simply something representative of your work. 
It is a common practice in software development and has been found to be the most effective way to find bugs.
Here is an interesting read, introducing code review to scientists: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.5648v2.pdf
It is important to note that in a code review we discuss the code, not the person who wrote it.

*Why are you founding this group?*  
Many of us spend much of our times coding and it is the source of much despair and unhappiness.
Yet, we never actually talk about the code, only about the results it produces (if at all).
Doing a code review is a great way to learn.
When I present my code it is useful to hear comments and feedback and gain a different perspective on my work.
When other people present, I learn new techniques, am introduced to new packages, 
and pick up tricks I never would have otherwise seen.

*Who should attend?*  
Everyone who wants to. 
While this is a student initiative, every researcher in IA is welcome and encouraged to participate.
A comfortable and inclusive environment will be enforced. [I MEAN NO SHAMING BUT I SHOULD PHRASE IT DIFFERENTLY]
People with all levels of programming skills are welcome and encouraged to attend.


*When?*  
TBD and announced.
Meetings will no take more than 1 hour.

*What can I do?*  
If you want to present a piece of code in the club, 
reply to this email, open an issue here or stop one of us in the corridors.
We would love to hear any thoughts, questions, or suggestion you have.

If you do not want to receive emails about the Code Review Club, reply to this email saying that.
